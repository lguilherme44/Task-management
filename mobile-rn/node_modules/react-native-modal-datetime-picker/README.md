This library exposes a cross-platform interface for showing the native date-picker and time-picker inside a modal, providing a unified user and developer experience.

Under the hood this library is using [`@react-native-community/datetimepicker`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-datetimepicker).

## Setup (for non-Expo projects)

If your project is not using [Expo](https://expo.io/), install the library and the community date/time picker using npm or yarn:

```bash
# using npm
$ npm i react-native-modal-datetime-picker @react-native-community/datetimepicker

# using yarn
$ yarn add react-native-modal-datetime-picker @react-native-community/datetimepicker
```

Please notice that the `@react-native-community/datetimepicker` package is a native module so [**it might require manual linking**](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-datetimepicker#getting-started).

## Setup (for Expo projects)

If your project is using [Expo](https://expo.io/), install the library and the community date/time picker using the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/):

```bash
expo install react-native-modal-datetime-picker @react-native-community/datetimepicker
```

## Usage

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Button, View } from "react-native";
import DateTimePickerModal from "react-native-modal-datetime-picker";

const Example = () => {
  const [isDatePickerVisible, setDatePickerVisibility] = useState(false);

  const showDatePicker = () => {
    setDatePickerVisibility(true);
  };

  const hideDatePicker = () => {
    setDatePickerVisibility(false);
  };

  const handleConfirm = (date) => {
    console.warn("A date has been picked: ", date);
    hideDatePicker();
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Show Date Picker" onPress={showDatePicker} />
      <DateTimePickerModal
        isVisible={isDatePickerVisible}
        mode="date"
        onConfirm={handleConfirm}
        onCancel={hideDatePicker}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default Example;
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### The component is not working as expected

Under the hood `react-native-modal-datetime-picker` uses [`@react-native-community/datetimepicker`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-datetimepicker).
Before reporting a bug, try swapping `react-native-datetime-picker` with [`@react-native-community/datetimepicker`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-datetimepicker) and, if the issue persists, check if it has already been reported as a an issue there.

### How can I show the timepicker instead of the datepicker?

Set the `mode` prop to `time`.
You can also display both the datepicker and the timepicker in one step by setting the `mode` prop to `datetime`.

### I can't set the initial date on the picker

Please make sure you're using the `date` props (and not the `value` one).

### The picker shows up twice on Android

This seems to be a known issue of the [`@react-native-community/datetimepicker`](https://github.com/react-native-community/datetimepicker/issues/54). Please see [this thread](https://github.com/react-native-community/datetimepicker/issues/54) for a couple of workarounds.

### How do I change the color of the Android date and time pickers?

This is more a React-Native specific question than a react-native-modal-datetime-picker one.  
See issue [#29](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/react-native-modal-datetime-picker/issues/29) and [#106](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/react-native-modal-datetime-picker/issues/106) for some solutions.

### How to set 24 hours in iOS ?

The `is24Hour` prop is only available on Android but you can use a small hack for enabling it on iOS by setting the picker timezone to `en_GB`:

```js
<DatePicker
  mode="time"
  locale="en_GB" // Use "en_GB" here
  date={new Date()}
/>
```

### How can I set an automatic locale in iOS

The datepicker can adjust by itself the locale (`fr_FR`, `en_GB`...) depending on the user's device locale.
To do so, edit your `AppDelegate.m` file and add the following to `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`.

```objc
// Force DatePicker locale to current language (for: 24h or 12h format, full day names etc...)
NSString *currentLanguage = [[NSLocale preferredLanguages] firstObject];
[[UIDatePicker appearance] setLocale:[[NSLocale alloc]initWithLocaleIdentifier:currentLanguage]];
```

### I can't see the picker on iOS/the picker is white on iOS

Your app is probably running in dark mode, which is [not supported by React-Native for the pickers yet](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/26299).  
If you're not planning to support the iOS dark mode in your app, add the following to your `info.plist`:

```xml
<key>UIUserInterfaceStyle</key>
<string>Light</string>
```

Otherwise, see the "Is the iOS dark mode supported?" section below ðŸ‘‡

### Is the iOS dark mode supported?

iOS 13 dark mode is not supported out-of-the-box yet and requires a bit of manual setup:

1. Import [useColorScheme](https://reactnative.dev/docs/usecolorscheme) from React-Native.
2. Use this hook to detect the device color scheme: ` const colorScheme = useColorScheme();`
3. Use the color scheme to enable/disable the `react-native-modal-datetime-picker` dark mode trough the `isDarkModeEnabled` prop: `isDarkModeEnabled: colorScheme === 'dark'`

### How do I make it work with snapshot testing?

See issue [#216](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/react-native-modal-datetime-picker/issues/216) for a possible workaround.
